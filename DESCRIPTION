Description: A set of tools for the peak filtering of mass spectrometry
  imaging data (MSI or IMS) based on spatial distribution of signal. Given a 
  region-of-interest (ROI), representing the spatial region where the informative signal is expected to be
  localized, a series of filters determine which peak signals are characterized by
  an implausible spatial distribution. The filters reduce the dataset dimensionality
  and increase its information vs noise ratio, improving the quality of the
  unsupervised analysis results, reducing data dimensionality and simplifying
  the chemical interpretation.
