## [1.1] - 2018-10-19
### Added
- New ROI detection using linear SVM. The user must select representative regions of the off-sample and
  sample-related areas. Then, a linear SVM performs the segmentation of the data, generating the ROI.
- New ROI detection using k-means with a larger number of clusters than 2. This allows a finer detection of the
  sample-related region.
- Now the covariate image for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be passed as argument of the function
  'CSRPeaksFilter' (see doc).
- New functions 'addBorderImage' and 'remBorderImage' to add or remove a border of N pixels from an MS image
### Fixed
- Fixed the SSIM function (it does not require scaling)
- Fixed typos in the help

## [1.0.4.1] - 2018-10-08
### Removed
- Removed dependency from 'autothresholdr' package. Now Otsu is performed using
the function threshold(x, 'auto') from 'imager'.

## [1.0.4] - 2018-10-06
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the function .match.mz.array.
- Improved the comments in the function .match.mz.array.
